# Static Web Group Project - Band Website

As a team, build the web site for the band name your team has been given. The team gets to decide how you interpret your band name. Be creative and have fun.

## Requirements

### Theme

Pick a theme that the team likes. A good place for inspiration is the [Wordpress themes](https://wordpress.org/themes/) site. Do not purchase, or copy the theme code, just browse them for inspiration. Everyone should agree on a theme and ensure that each page is consistent with the colors, fonts, and/or images chosen.

Remeber this is a band website - there will be EXTRA BONUS points given to your team if you make your site look like a myspace page.

* Your team can only have 1 CSS file - main.css
* Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS only
* Your team can not use any kind of framework (no bootstrap, materialize, etc).

### Pages
Each team member is going to be responsible for the content of a different page, so decide on the name and content for each of those pages. Some possible options are...

1. Home page
1. Band Members
1. Tour Schedule
1. Album List
1. Song List

Each page should have some sort of reusable component that gets put into the dom via a string builder and a print to dom function in the JS file.  For example if you are building the Album page you should store all your albums in an array in the JS file and use JS to loop over the array and display them.

### Teamwork

Create a Project board for your company site and make the columns for ('Todo', 'In Progress', 'Code Review', 'done'). Create notes for different units of work, make the notes into issues, and assign it to the team members doing to work. When you are assigned to an issue, make sure that you are moving it over to the right column on the board.

### Git
Your team is going to learn how to use git to enable good teamwork when building a software product.

1. Follow the instructons in class to clone down the repo
1. `cd` into the directory that got created.
1. Before anyone on the team writes a single line of code, the team will decide on a branch naming strategy. Branches should be descriptive of the work that is going to be done on that branch. Some teams also decide to add the developer's information to the branch name, such as initials. For example, a developer named Jasmine Sheboygen is going to work on the job listings page for the web site. A good name for the branch would be `js-job-listing-page`.
1. Your team already has a README.md file so there is no reason anyone should EVER push to the master branch.

Now everyone will work on their page on those individual branches. Once a teammates feels that their work is complete, the teammate will push up their branch to Github and create a pull request. Decide as group your standard for reviewing and approving pull requests, for example, you may decide that each PR needs one thumbs up from another teammate, you may decide that everyone in the group needs to give it a thumbs up, etc. At the very least, one of the other teammates must review the pull request and give a thumbs up (Just type :+1 in the comment box).
```bash
# Check to make sure that your working tree is clean. Add and commit all that you need to.
git checkout master
git fetch
git branch -al 
# ^ The code above shows you all active branches that are available to you on GitHub. 
git checkout your-teammates-branch-name
# Test test test
```

Once the PR gets a thumbs up, the teammates should merge the current version of master (the one with all their teammate's fancy additions) to their current working branch by following this process:

```bash
# Check to make sure that your working tree is clean. Add and commit all that you need to.
git checkout master
git pull origin master
git checkout your-branch-name
git merge master
# Fix any merge conflicts, if you have them
# git add and git commit any files affected by the merge conflict.
```

Now you have all of your work, plus all of your teammate's approved work on one branch. :cool:

### Javascript
* EVERY SINGE PAGE must include a JS loop of some kind 
* Your team can only have 1 JS file - main.js
* All your JS should be written in functions.  Wherever possible reuseable functions.
* At lease 1 of your pages should use a more complex data structure.  This means that one of your arrays should have an array inside each object.  For examle:  Each of your band members could have an array called favoriteSongs that has numbers in it that correspond to ids on your songs array.  To display the favorite songs you have to look the songs up by id.

### Readme
The current readme in your repo just has a title it should be complete for your demo.  Remember the minimum requirements for a readme are:
* Title
* Description
* screenshot(s)
* Steps to run the project
